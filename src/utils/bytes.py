    Returns list of utf-8 byte and a mapping to unicode strings. We specifically avoids mapping to whitespace/control
    characters the bpe code barfs on.

    The reversible bpe codes work on unicode strings. This means you need a large # of unicode characters in your vocab
    if you want to avoid UNKs. When you're at something like a 10B token dataset you end up needing around 5K for
    decent coverage. This is a significant percentage of your normal, say, 32K bpe vocab. To avoid that, we want lookup
    tables between utf-8 bytes and unicode strings.
